This app is built on top of the work contained in Todd Schneider's
[BallR shiny app](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/ballr-interactive-nba-shot-charts-with-r-and-shiny/) 

It uses the [NBA Stats API](http://stats.nba.com/) to visualize every shot taken by a player during an NBA season dating back to 1996.
